# Interfacing-Sensors

This Repository contains the interfacing with working of sensors on Raspberry Pi(3b) and Arduino (UNO/MEGA/NANO) independently as well as with the result being displayed on LCD

**Do check the pin configuration in  the code for displaying the result on LCD for each sensor as some pins may be different for the sensor**

**THE CODE AND SCHEMATICS FOR LCD IS GIVEN IN A FOLDER NAMED LCD(16x2) INSIDE INTERFACING-SENSORS**
