# **Interfacing Switch with Raspberry Pi 3 (any version)**

**There are many kinds of switches available like collision switch, ball switch, reed switch, shock switch ,etc. All of them can be run using any of the code given here**

The Code to run for the sensor is given in the python file (.py).

**Sensor Pin is connected to GPIO.BCM = 2 and the LED is connected to GPIO.BCM = 26**

The Circuit Diagram is given in the JPG file.

**THE CODE AND SCHEMATICS FOR LCD IS GIVEN IN A FOLDER NAMED LCD(16x2) INSIDE INTERFACING-SENSORS/RASPBERRY-PI/**
